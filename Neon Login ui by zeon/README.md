# All Unique Characters Challenge

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/zeonzurich/pen/poLxJrZ](https://codepen.io/zeonzurich/pen/poLxJrZ).

In this challenge, we were asked to "Write a function that determines if all
the characters in a given string are unique." This can be done with multiple approaches. For example, looping each element through an array. I have chosen to use the Set() function and measure the length with the original String.
